% POSTER EXAMPLE
%
% This is an example of a relatively sane poster. The box structure (and the
% narrative in general) is what I would expect, but it is completely
% non-mandatory; you may include whatever you want. Preferably, erase the
% existing box structure after you read it, and start from scratch.
%
% The main communication requirements for the poster that should be satisfied
% are as such:
%
% - At the defense, it should help you talk for around 10 minutes about your
%   thesis, and convince the committee that you did something interesting and
%   sufficiently complicated. Prepare pictures that explain your main results.
%
% - It should quickly communicate the main idea of your thesis to a random
%   educated by-walker. Ideally, a moderately-witted MFF graduate who has never
%   heard about your thesis before should be able to get the main "rough idea"
%   in less than 1 minute by just looking at the poster.

% modify the fontscale parameter to make everything slighly bigger or smaller.

% A WORD ABOUT COLORS
%
% This template is prepared with a relatively neutral gray background that
% gives decent box borders (with white and darker gray), does not clash with
% many colors (except for violet-brown and other mushroomish colors, perhaps)
% and gives a lot of space for highlighting stuff.
%
% Generally, other color variations are good too; there are no strict rules on
% the colors. Good choices include:
%
% - white backgrounds and differentiation of box headers by color (see
%   headerFontColor)
%
% - various slightly tinted backgrounds (try red!10 instead of black!3)
% 
% - dark backgrounds
%
% Keep in mind:
% - The normal "informative" text and figures should be DARK on LIGHT
%   background, not the other way around.
%
% - If you want a dark background, soften (darken) the box backgrounds a bit so
%   that they do not "shine" too much from the poster. Use \color{white} for
%   the heading, and switch the UK/MFF logos to white (see contents of logos/).
%
% - Do not mix too many color hues together. Most hues have their widely
%   accepted meaning (green: good result, red: problem, blue: information,
%   yellow: highlighter, brown: serious problem, violet: something really
%   weird/interesting/magic, depending on the shade).

% LEFT COLUMN
%

\begin{posterbox}[column=0,name=background]{Background}
Describe what is the problem that your thesis addresses.

Include a picture of the problem. Name the problem.

\begin{center}\begin{tikzpicture}[ultra thick, inner sep=1ex]
\node[rectangle, rounded corners=1ex, draw=red!80!black, color=red!80!black, font=\huge\bfseries, rotate=21] {Problem!};
\end{tikzpicture}\end{center}
\end{posterbox}

\begin{posterbox}[column=0, name=goals, below=background, headerColorOne=cyan!60, boxColorOne=cyan!20]{Thesis goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item How do you approach and address the problem?
\item What tools do you use to address it?
\item \dots
\end{itemize}

Highlighting important boxes helps a lot, but do not overdo the highlighting --- if all boxes are highlighted, not a single one will actually stand out.
\end{posterbox}

\begin{posterbox}[column=0, name=something1, below=goals]{Some extra boxes}
This box may contain an overview of the used methods, mathematics, program structure, etc.

Include a picture, because pictures are better. Thesis defense takes less than 10 minutes, no one can read a wall of text in that short time. (For comparison, the usual realistic poster visit on a conference takes 15 seconds, unless the poster manages to catch the attention in that short time.)

\tikzstyle{rec}=[rectangle, draw, rounded corners=1ex, font=\huge\bfseries]

\node[rec] (a) {Keep};
\node[rec, circle, right=of a] (b) {it};
\node[rec, right=of b] (c) {simple};

\end{posterbox}

\begin{posterbox}[column=0, name=something2, below=something1, headerColorOne=yellow!80!orange!95!black, boxColorOne=yellow!33]{Golden rule of posters}
For each $p \in P$ where $P$ is a set of posters:
$$ \textsc{Success}(p) = \frac{\textsc{Clarity}(p)}{\textsc{TimeToViewerAttention}(p)} $$
\end{posterbox}

% RIGHT COLUMN

% It is usually best to fill most of the poster with your results and
% conclusions. Again, use simple annotated pictures wherever possible. Plots
% with measurements are perfect, tables are also good.

You may want to choose a single picture and make it stand out of the poster, so that it communicates the main result of your thesis as clearly as possible.

\begin{itemize}
\item explain the value of your result to others
\item point out any applications
\item if the program is online/opensource/on github, you may highlight it here
\end{itemize}
Possible future work:
\begin{itemize}
