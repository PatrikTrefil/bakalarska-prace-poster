# Simple MFF poster starter

A poster "starter" non-template.

How-to:

- Build with `make`; a [pre-built version is available](build/poster.pdf).
- Read extra commentary in `poster.tex`.
- Make sure you __erase all text and box structure__ from the starter after
  reading it; both is almost surely wrong for your use case.
